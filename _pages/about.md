I am a final-year student at Stanford pursuing an MS in theoretical computer science and BS in pure math. Throughout my studies, I've explored many different fields, and my interests remain quite wide.

Currently, I am visting the [Quantum Systems Lab](https://www.yongshanding.com/) at Yale working on scalable quantum computing architectures. I am also working with [Dr. Roger Blandford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Blandford) on a theory for JWST's ["little red dot"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_red_dot_(cosmological_object)) galaxies. Finally, I am generalizing the analysis of [my prior work at Amazon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07952), a game theory model of direct price competition with revenue sharing.

Previously, I worked on reinforcement learning for [supply chain optimization](https://www.amazon.science/tag/supply-chain-optimization-technologies) at Amazon, used machine learning to accelerate specialty gas R&D at semiconductor manufacturer [EMD Electronics](https://www.emdgroup.com/en/expertise/electronics.html), and did classified work on [BACN](https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/mission-solutions/battlefield-airborne-communications-node-bacn) at [Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com/). I also founded two startups, one which [used generative AI for personalized sales emails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknO1XVqjw0) and another which [created portable hydroelectric generators for backpackers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPteQWwHVIQ).   

Outside of all this, I enjoy running long distances, hiking, playing poker, and reading philosophy. Check out the [vlog from my recent 100KM race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY8IicN8Fns), a [blog post on the good life](https://rajpabari.com/goals-responsibilities-and-the-good-lifewhy-i-make-my-bed-every-morning/), or a [blog post about how and why I ran 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours](https://rajpabari.com/how-and-why-i-ran-4-miles-every-4-hours-for-48-hours/).
